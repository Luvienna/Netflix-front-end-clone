# Netflix Clone (Front-End)

## Project Overview
This project is a front-end replica of the Netflix user interface. It was a challenging and rewarding exercise in replicating a modern, widely-used application to hone my front-end development skills. The goal was to build a visually accurate and responsive user experience, focusing on dynamic content display and smooth navigation.

## Key Features
- Responsive UI: The layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
- Content Carousels: Interactive sections for browsing movies and TV shows by category.
- Dynamic Sections: Content is displayed in a familiar, organized format, with sections like "Trending Now" and "Top Rated."
_ Trailer Playback: (Optional, add if you included it) A feature to play a video trailer in a modal or pop-up.

## Technologies Used
- HTML: To structure the main components and content of the page.
- CSS: For styling, including the use of Flexbox and Grid to create a responsive, organized layout.
- JavaScript: To handle all interactive elements, such as carousels and fetching data (if a mock API was used).
